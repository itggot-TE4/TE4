# TE4
Template project for projects at TE4

Replace this with a description for the project.

## Project management setup
- Use projects tab for adding kanban boards for issue tracking and bug triage board.
- Use issues and labels for assigning points to tasks and categorizing tasks.

## Code review
Code review is the process that happens after a new pull request is created and before the changes are merged to develop. Use the following guidelines as a reference: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review

## Testing
Every developer has heard of how useful tests are but to actually think in a TDD manner is something entirely different. Consider the different types of tests: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/05/05/TestDefinitions.html

## Continious integration
Every commit that is pushed to the remote should be free of syntax errors and should still pass the "build" phase + basic tests. To reinforce testing into an application a CI pipeline is put in place to check every commit and even update reports for code coverage or automatic merging of code. [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is one of the simplest solutions to this. Update the .github/workflows yaml files for the project specific configuration. 

## Code quality
There are several tools that can be integrated into the CI pipeline. One of those tools can be used to monitor code quality. [Code climate](https://codeclimate.com/quality/) is a free application which has support for finding duplicated code and can be setup to reinfore a certain codestyle.

Another tool that can be used in the CI pipeline is [Semmle QL](https://help.semmle.com/QL/learn-ql/) for automatic security checks on new pull requests.

## Refactoring
Refactoring is the process of improving the design of existing code without altering its external behavior. It's a critical step in the process, but often overlooked. This should be part of a strong code review culture on any serious project.

## Git flow
- Don't push to master, use a develop branch
